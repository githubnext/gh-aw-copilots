**Planning diff analysis**

I'm realizing that our function returns detailed file diffs, including status, additions, deletions, and a potentially truncated patch field. That's great! I need to parse that information thoroughly. The user asks for a diff analysis focusing on purpose and impact, so I’ll categorize the changes by type, count additions and deletions, and summarize the results in simple bullet points. I’ll incorporate the PR title and description and then add a comment. So, let’s start executing those planned calls!

✅ github::list_pull_requests(...)

✅ `bash -lc 'git remote -v'`

✅ `bash -lc 'git branch --show-current'`

✅ github::search_pull_requests(...)

**Summarizing PR search results**

The user wants to find a branch name containing "codex," but it seems there are no open PRs fitting that description. I see that closed PR #39 addressed "Fix Codex token usage," but since it's closed, it's not relevant to the user's request. Therefore, I need to inform the user that I couldn't find any open PRs. I'll suggest they specify a PR number instead, and offer a summary noting the absence of relevant open PRs.

**Communicating PR status**

It looks like there's no open PR with a "codex" branch to comment on. Instead of creating a comment, I'll inform the user directly that no relevant PR exists. I’ll say something like: "I didn't find any open pull request in this repo containing 'codex'. Please check the PR number or ensure it’s open." I want to make sure the user understands there's no open PR. I'll include an ask for clarification to help them further.

I didn’t find any open pull requests whose branch name contains “codex” in this repository.

Please verify that the PR is open and its branch includes “codex,” or let me know the PR number so I can fetch its details and generate the requested summary.
