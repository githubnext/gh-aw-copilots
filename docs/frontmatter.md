# ‚öôÔ∏è Frontmatter Options for GitHub Actions

This guide covers all available frontmatter configuration options for agentic workflows.

## Overview

The YAML frontmatter supports standard GitHub Actions properties plus additional agentic-specific options:

**Standard GitHub Actions Properties:**
- `on`: Trigger events for the workflow
- `permissions`: Required permissions for the workflow
- `run-name`: Name of the workflow run
- `runs-on`: Runner environment for the workflow
- `timeout_minutes`: Workflow timeout
- `concurrency`: Concurrency settings for the workflow
- `env`: Environment variables for the workflow
- `if`: Conditional execution of the workflow
- `steps`: Custom steps for the job

**Agentic-Specific Properties:**
- `engine`: AI engine configuration (claude/codex)
- `tools`: Available tools and MCP servers for the AI engine  
- `stop-time`: Deadline when workflow should stop running (absolute or relative time)
- `max-turns`: Maximum number of chat iterations per run
- `alias`: Alias name for the workflow
- `ai-reaction`: Emoji reaction to add/remove on triggering GitHub item
- `cache`: Cache configuration for workflow dependencies
- `output`: Output processing configuration for automatic issue creation and comment posting

## Trigger Events (`on:`)

Standard GitHub Actions `on:` trigger section:

```yaml
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
```

**Default behavior** (if no `on:` specified):
```yaml
on:
  # Semi-active agent - triggers frequently and on repository activity
  schedule:
    - cron: "0/10 * * * *"
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, edited, closed]
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:
```

## Special `alias:` Trigger

GitHub Agentic Workflows add the convenience `alias:` trigger to create workflows that respond to `@mentions` in issues and comments.

```yaml
on:
  alias:
    name: my-bot  # Optional: defaults to filename without .md extension
```

This automatically creates:
- Issue and PR triggers (`opened`, `edited`, `reopened`)
- Comment triggers (`created`, `edited`)
- Conditional execution matching `@alias-name` mentions

You can combine `alias:` with other events like `workflow_dispatch` or `schedule`:

```yaml
on:
  alias:
    name: my-bot
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 9 * * 1"
```

**Note**: You cannot combine `alias` with `issues`, `issue_comment`, or `pull_request` as they would conflict.

**Note**: Using this feature results in the addition of `.github/actions/check-team-member/action.yml` file to the repository when the workflow is compiled. This file is used to check if the user triggering the workflow has appropriate permissions to operate in the repository.

#### Example alias workflow

```markdown
---
on:
  alias:
    name: summarize-issue
permissions:
  issues: write
tools:
  github:
    allowed: [add_issue_comment]
---

# Issue Summarizer

When someone mentions @summarize-issue in an issue or comment, 
analyze and provide a helpful summary.

The current context text is: "${{ needs.task.outputs.text }}"
```

## Context Text (`needs.task.outputs.text`)

All workflows have access to a special computed `needs.task.outputs.text` value that provides context based on the triggering event:

```markdown
# Analyze this content: "${{ needs.task.outputs.text }}"
```

**How `text` is computed:**
- **Issues**: `title + "\n\n" + body`
- **Pull Requests**: `title + "\n\n" + body`  
- **Issue Comments**: `comment.body`
- **PR Review Comments**: `comment.body`
- **PR Reviews**: `review.body`
- **Other events**: Empty string

**Note**: Using this feature results in the addition of ".github/actions/compute-text/action.yml" file to the repository when the workflow is compiled.

## Permissions (`permissions:`)

Standard GitHub Actions permissions syntax. See [GitHub Actions permissions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#permissions).

```yaml
# Specific permissions
permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

# All permissions
permissions: write-all
permissions: read-all

# No permissions
permissions: {}
```

If you specify any permission, unspecified ones are set to `none`.

## AI Engine (`engine:`)

Specifies which AI engine to use. Defaults to `claude`.

```yaml
engine: claude  # Default: Claude Code
engine: codex   # Experimental: OpenAI Codex CLI with MCP support
```

**Engine Override**:
You can override the engine specified in frontmatter using CLI flags:
```bash
gh aw add weekly-research --engine codex
gh aw compile --engine claude
```

### Simple String Format

```yaml
engine: claude  # or codex
```

### Extended Object Format

```yaml
engine:
  id: claude                        # Required: engine identifier
  version: beta                     # Optional: version of the action
  model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 # Optional: specific LLM model
```

**Fields:**
- **`id`** (required): Engine identifier (`claude`, `codex`)
- **`version`** (optional): Action version (`beta`, `stable`)
- **`model`** (optional): Specific LLM model to use

**Model Defaults:**
- **Claude**: Uses the default model from the claude-code-base-action (typically latest Claude model)
- **Codex**: Defaults to `o4-mini` when no model is specified

## Cost Control Options

### Maximum Turns (`max-turns:`)

Limit the number of chat iterations within a single agentic run:

```yaml
max-turns: 5
```

**Behavior:**
1. Passes the limit to the AI engine (e.g., Claude Code action)
2. Engine stops iterating when the turn limit is reached
3. Helps prevent runaway chat loops and control costs
4. Only applies to engines that support turn limiting (currently Claude)

### Stop Time (`stop-time:`)

Automatically disable workflow after a deadline:

**Relative time delta (calculated from compilation time):**
```yaml
stop-time: "+25h"      # 25 hours from now
```

**Supported absolute date formats:**
- Standard: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`, `YYYY-MM-DD`
- US format: `MM/DD/YYYY HH:MM:SS`, `MM/DD/YYYY`  
- European: `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS`, `DD/MM/YYYY`
- Readable: `January 2, 2006`, `2 January 2006`, `Jan 2, 2006`
- Ordinals: `1st June 2025`, `June 1st 2025`, `23rd December 2025`
- ISO 8601: `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z`

**Supported delta units:**
- `d` - days
- `h` - hours
- `m` - minutes

Note that if you specify a relative time, it is calculated at the time of workflow compilation, not when the workflow runs. If you re-compile your workflow, e.g. after a change, the effective stop time will be reset.

## Visual Feedback (`ai-reaction:`)

Emoji reaction added/removed on triggering GitHub items:

```yaml
ai-reaction: "eyes"
```

**Available reactions:**
- `+1` (üëç)
- `-1` (üëé)
- `laugh` (üòÑ)
- `confused` (üòï)
- `heart` (‚ù§Ô∏è)
- `hooray` (üéâ)
- `rocket` (üöÄ)
- `eyes` (üëÄ)

**Note**: Using this feature results in the addition of ".github/actions/reaction/action.yml" file to the repository when the workflow is compiled.

## Output Processing (`output:`)

Configure automatic output processing from AI agent results. The output system enables agents to create GitHub issues, comments, or pull requests from their analysis without requiring write permissions in the main workflow job.

### How Output Processing Works

1. **Output File Creation**: The main job creates a secure temporary file (`/tmp/aw_output_${randomId}.txt`) accessible via the `GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT` environment variable
2. **Content Sanitization**: Agent output is automatically sanitized to prevent adversarial attacks (removes control characters, limits size to 0.5MB and 65k lines, strips ANSI codes)
3. **Job Separation**: Separate jobs handle write operations, providing security isolation and precise permission scoping
4. **Artifact Flow**: Output content flows between jobs via GitHub Actions outputs and artifacts

```yaml
output:
  issue:
    title-prefix: "[ai] "           # Optional: prefix for issue titles
    labels: [automation, ai-agent]  # Optional: labels to attach to issues
  comment: {}                       # Create comments on issues/PRs from agent output
  pull-request:
    title-prefix: "[ai] "           # Optional: prefix for PR titles
    labels: [automation, ai-agent]  # Optional: labels to attach to PRs
    draft: true                     # Optional: create as draft PR (defaults to true)
```

### Security Considerations

- **Content Sanitization**: All agent output is automatically sanitized to remove potentially malicious content
- **Size Limits**: Content is limited to 0.5MB total and 65,000 lines to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Permission Isolation**: Only output-specific jobs receive write permissions, never the main agent job
- **Branch Security**: Pull request branches use cryptographically secure random naming (`{workflowId}/{randomHex}`)
- **Timeout Protection**: All output jobs have 10-minute timeouts to prevent hanging workflows

### Issue Creation (`output.issue`)

**Behavior:**
- When `output.issue` is configured, the compiler automatically generates a separate `create_issue` job
- This job runs after the main AI agent job completes
- The agent's output content flows from the main job to the issue creation job via job output variables
- The issue creation job parses the output content, using the first non-empty line as the title and the remainder as the body
- **Important**: With output processing, the main job **does not** need `issues: write` permission since the write operation is performed in the separate job

**Generated Job Properties:**
- **Job Name**: `create_issue`
- **Dependencies**: Runs after the main agent job (`needs: [main-job-name]`)
- **Permissions**: Only the issue creation job has `issues: write` permission
- **Timeout**: 10-minute timeout to prevent hanging
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration passed via `GITHUB_AW_ISSUE_TITLE_PREFIX` and `GITHUB_AW_ISSUE_LABELS`
- **Outputs**: Returns `issue_number` and `issue_url` for downstream jobs

**Content Processing:**
- **Title Extraction**: First non-empty line becomes the issue title (markdown headers are stripped)
- **Body Creation**: Remaining content forms the issue body, preserving formatting
- **Parent Issue Linking**: When triggered by an issue event, creates a bi-directional link to the parent issue
- **Workflow Attribution**: Automatically adds a reference to the generating workflow run

**Artifact Integration:**
- Agent output is uploaded as `aw_output.txt` artifact for debugging
- Output appears in GitHub Actions step summary for visibility
- Issue creation details are added to the workflow run summary

### Comment Creation (`output.comment`)

**Behavior:**
- When `output.comment` is configured, the compiler automatically generates a separate `create_issue_comment` job
- This job runs after the main AI agent job completes and **only** if the workflow is triggered by an issue or pull request event
- The agent's output content flows from the main job to the comment creation job via job output variables
- The comment creation job posts the entire agent output as a comment on the triggering issue or pull request
- **Conditional Execution**: The job automatically skips if not running in an issue or pull request context

**Generated Job Properties:**
- **Job Name**: `create_issue_comment`
- **Dependencies**: Runs after the main agent job (`needs: [main-job-name]`)
- **Conditional**: Only runs when `github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number` is present
- **Permissions**: Only the comment creation job has `issues: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions
- **Timeout**: 10-minute timeout to prevent hanging
- **Outputs**: Returns `comment_id` and `comment_url` for downstream jobs

**Context Detection:**
- **Issue Context**: Triggered by `issues` or `issue_comment` events
- **Pull Request Context**: Triggered by `pull_request`, `pull_request_review`, or `pull_request_review_comment` events
- **Automatic Skipping**: For other trigger types (e.g., `push`, `schedule`), the job runs but exits early

**Content Processing:**
- **Direct Output**: The entire sanitized agent output becomes the comment body
- **Workflow Attribution**: Automatically appends a reference to the generating workflow run
- **Format Preservation**: Original formatting and markdown in agent output is preserved

**Example workflow using issue creation:**
```yaml
---
on: push
permissions:
  contents: read      # Main job only needs minimal permissions
  actions: read
engine: claude
output:
  issue:
    title-prefix: "[analysis] "
    labels: [automation, code-review]
---

# Code Analysis Agent

Analyze the latest commit and provide insights.
Write your analysis to ${{ env.GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT }} at the end.
```

**Example workflow using comment creation:**
```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  contents: read      # Main job only needs minimal permissions
  actions: read
engine: claude
output:
  comment: {}
---

# Issue/PR Analysis Agent

Analyze the issue or pull request and provide feedback.
Write your analysis to ${{ env.GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT }} at the end.
```

This automatically creates GitHub issues or comments from the agent's analysis without requiring write permissions on the main job.

### Pull Request Creation (`output.pull-request`)

**Behavior:**
- When `output.pull-request` is configured, the compiler automatically generates a separate `create_pull_request` job
- This job runs after the main AI agent job completes
- The agent's output content flows from the main job to the pull request creation job via job output variables
- The job creates a new branch, applies git patches from the agent's output, and creates a pull request
- **Important**: With output processing, the main job **does not** need `contents: write` permission since the write operation is performed in the separate job

**Generated Job Properties:**
- **Job Name**: `create_pull_request`
- **Dependencies**: Runs after the main agent job (`needs: [main-job-name]`)
- **Permissions**: Only the pull request creation job has `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` permissions
- **Timeout**: 10-minute timeout to prevent hanging
- **Environment Variables**: Configuration passed via `GITHUB_AW_PR_TITLE_PREFIX`, `GITHUB_AW_PR_LABELS`, `GITHUB_AW_PR_DRAFT`, `GITHUB_AW_WORKFLOW_ID`, and `GITHUB_AW_BASE_BRANCH`
- **Branch Creation**: Uses cryptographic random hex for secure branch naming (`{workflowId}/{randomHex}`)
- **Git Operations**: Creates branch using git CLI, applies patches, commits changes, and pushes to GitHub
- **Outputs**: Returns `pull_request_number`, `pull_request_url`, and `branch_name` for downstream jobs

**Patch Requirements:**
- **Patch File**: The agent must create git patches in `/tmp/aw.patch` for the changes to be applied
- **Validation**: The pull request creation job validates patch existence and content before proceeding
- **Error Handling**: Job fails gracefully if no valid patch is found, preventing empty pull requests

**Branch and Commit Management:**
- **Branch Naming**: `{workflowId}/{8-character-random-hex}` for uniqueness and security
- **Git Configuration**: Automatically configures git with GitHub Action credentials
- **Commit Message**: Uses extracted title from agent output or defaults to "Add agent output: {title}"
- **Base Branch**: Uses `github.ref_name` from the triggering workflow context

**Content Processing:**
- **Title/Body Extraction**: Same logic as issue creation - first line becomes title, rest becomes body
- **Label Application**: Labels are applied after PR creation using the GitHub Issues API
- **Draft Handling**: Respects the `draft` setting, defaulting to `true` for safety

**Configuration:**
```yaml
output:
  pull-request:
    title-prefix: "[ai] "           # Optional: prefix for PR titles
    labels: [automation, ai-agent]  # Optional: labels to attach to PRs
    draft: true                     # Optional: create as draft PR (defaults to true)
```

## Practical Examples

### Multi-Output Workflow
```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  contents: read      # Main job only needs read permissions
  actions: read
engine: claude
output:
  issue:              # Create follow-up issues from analysis
    title-prefix: "[analysis] "
    labels: [automation, analysis]
  comment:            # Also comment on the original issue/PR
  pull-request:       # Create PRs with fixes when applicable
    title-prefix: "[fix] "
    labels: [automation, fix]
    draft: false
---

# Comprehensive Code Analysis Agent

Analyze the code and provide:
1. Summary comment on the original issue/PR
2. Detailed analysis in a new issue
3. Automated fixes in a pull request (when applicable)

Write your summary to ${{ env.GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT }}.
Generate patches to /tmp/aw.patch for any fixes.
```

### Issue Analysis with Parent Linking
```yaml
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]
permissions:
  contents: read
engine: claude
output:
  issue:
    title-prefix: "[breakdown] "
    labels: [automation, task-breakdown]
---

# Task Breakdown Agent

Break down complex issues into smaller actionable tasks.
Each task will be created as a separate issue linked to this one.

Write your breakdown to ${{ env.GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT }} with:
- First line: Summary title
- Remaining lines: Detailed breakdown
```

### Code Review with Pull Request
```yaml
---
on: 
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
permissions:
  contents: read
engine: claude
output:
  comment: {}         # Provide review comments
  pull-request:       # Suggest improvements
    title-prefix: "[suggestions] "
    labels: [review, improvements]
    draft: true
---

# Code Review Agent

Review the pull request and provide feedback.
Create suggested improvements as a draft PR.

1. Write review comments to ${{ env.GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT }}
2. Generate improvement patches to /tmp/aw.patch
```

## Troubleshooting Output Processing

### Common Issues

**Output Job Not Running:**
- Check that the main job completed successfully and produced output
- Verify the main job has the correct dependencies (`needs: [main-job-name]`)
- Ensure required permissions are granted to the output job, not the main job

**Empty or Missing Output:**
- Verify agent writes to `${{ env.GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT }}` file, not stdout
- Check that content is written before the main job completes
- Review the "Collect agent output" step logs for sanitization warnings

**Pull Request Creation Fails:**
- Ensure `/tmp/aw.patch` exists and contains valid git patches
- Verify patch content doesn't include error messages or invalid formats
- Check that the base branch exists and is accessible

**Comment Job Skips Unexpectedly:**
- Comment jobs only run for issue and pull request contexts
- Verify the triggering event provides `github.event.issue.number` or `github.event.pull_request.number`
- Check the conditional execution logic in job logs

**Permission Denied Errors:**
- Output jobs need write permissions, not the main job
- Verify `issues: write` for issue/comment jobs
- Verify `contents: write` and `pull-requests: write` for PR jobs

### Debug Information

All workflows with output processing include automatic debugging aids:

- **Step Summary**: Agent output appears in the GitHub Actions run summary
- **Artifacts**: Output content is uploaded as `aw_output.txt` for inspection
- **Verbose Logging**: All output jobs include detailed console logging
- **Job Outputs**: Created resources return URLs and IDs for downstream use

### Performance Considerations

- **Content Size**: Large outputs (>0.5MB) are automatically truncated
- **Job Timeouts**: Output jobs timeout after 10 minutes to prevent hanging
- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple output jobs run in parallel when possible
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider GitHub API rate limits when creating many outputs

**Required Patch Format:**
The agent must create git patches in `/tmp/aw.patch` for the changes to be applied. The pull request creation job validates patch existence and content before proceeding.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Output File Mechanics

The output system uses a secure temporary file approach:

1. **File Creation**: A unique output file is created at `/tmp/aw_output_${randomId}.txt` using cryptographic random generation
2. **Environment Variable**: The file path is made available via `GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT` environment variable
3. **Agent Integration**: Agents write their final output to this file using: `echo "content" >> $GITHUB_AW_OUTPUT`
4. **Collection**: A separate step reads and sanitizes the content for downstream jobs

### Content Sanitization Pipeline

All agent output undergoes automatic sanitization to prevent security issues:

```javascript
// Sanitization process applied to all output
function sanitizeContent(content) {
  // Remove control characters (except newlines and tabs)
  let sanitized = content.replace(/[\x00-\x08\x0B\x0C\x0E-\x1F\x7F]/g, '');
  
  // Limit total length to prevent DoS (0.5MB max)
  const maxLength = 524288;
  if (sanitized.length > maxLength) {
    sanitized = sanitized.substring(0, maxLength) + '\n[Content truncated due to length]';
  }
  
  // Limit number of lines to prevent log flooding (65k max)
  const lines = sanitized.split('\n');
  const maxLines = 65000;
  if (lines.length > maxLines) {
    sanitized = lines.slice(0, maxLines).join('\n') + '\n[Content truncated due to line count]';
  }
  
  // Remove ANSI escape sequences
  sanitized = sanitized.replace(/\x1b\[[0-9;]*[mGKH]/g, '');
  
  return sanitized.trim();
}
```

### Job Dependency Flow

Output processing uses a multi-job architecture for security and reliability:

```
Main Agent Job
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Outputs: { output: "sanitized-content" }
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artifacts: { aw_output.txt, aw.patch }
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Step Summary: Agent output preview

Output Jobs (run in parallel)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create_issue (if configured)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inputs: needs.main-job.outputs.output
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Permissions: issues: write
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Outputs: { issue_number, issue_url }
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ create_issue_comment (if configured + context)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inputs: needs.main-job.outputs.output  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Permissions: issues: write, pull-requests: write
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Outputs: { comment_id, comment_url }
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ create_pull_request (if configured)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inputs: needs.main-job.outputs.output + aw.patch artifact
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Permissions: contents: write, pull-requests: write
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Outputs: { pull_request_number, pull_request_url, branch_name }
```

### Error Handling and Resilience

- **Empty Output**: Jobs gracefully handle empty or missing agent output
- **Invalid Patches**: Pull request job validates patch content before attempting to apply
- **Context Mismatches**: Comment job automatically skips when not in issue/PR context  
- **Timeout Protection**: All output jobs have 10-minute timeouts to prevent workflow hanging
- **Permission Failures**: Clear error messages when required permissions are missing
- **Debugging Support**: All output is preserved in artifacts and step summaries for troubleshooting

**Required Patch Format:**
The agent must create git patches in `/tmp/aw.patch` for the changes to be applied. The pull request creation job validates patch existence and content before proceeding.

## Cache Configuration (`cache:`)

Cache configuration using GitHub Actions `actions/cache` syntax:

### Single Cache
```yaml
cache:
  key: node-modules-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
  path: node_modules
  restore-keys: |
    node-modules-
```

### Multiple Caches
```yaml
cache:
  - key: node-modules-${{ hashFiles('package-lock.json') }}
    path: node_modules
    restore-keys: |
      node-modules-
  - key: build-cache-${{ github.sha }}
    path: 
      - dist
      - .cache
    restore-keys:
      - build-cache-
    fail-on-cache-miss: false
```

**Supported Parameters:**
- `key:` - Cache key (required)
- `path:` - Files/directories to cache (required, string or array)
- `restore-keys:` - Fallback keys (string or array)
- `upload-chunk-size:` - Chunk size for large files (integer)
- `fail-on-cache-miss:` - Fail if cache not found (boolean)
- `lookup-only:` - Only check cache existence (boolean)

## Standard GitHub Actions Properties

### Run Configuration

```yaml
run-name: "Custom workflow run name"  # Defaults to workflow name
runs-on: ubuntu-latest               # Defaults to ubuntu-latest
timeout_minutes: 30                  # Defaults to 15 minutes
```

### Concurrency Control

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

#### Enhanced Concurrency Policies

GitHub Agentic Workflows automatically generates enhanced concurrency policies based on workflow trigger types to provide better isolation and resource management. Different workflow types receive different concurrency groups and cancellation behavior:

| Trigger Type | Concurrency Group | Cancellation | Description |
|--------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| `issues` | `gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}` | ‚ùå | Issue workflows include issue number for isolation |
| `pull_request` | `gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number \|\| github.ref }}` | ‚úÖ | PR workflows include PR number with cancellation |
| `discussion` | `gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.discussion.number }}` | ‚ùå | Discussion workflows include discussion number |
| Mixed issue/PR | `gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number \|\| github.event.pull_request.number }}` | ‚úÖ | Mixed workflows handle both contexts with cancellation |
| Alias workflows | `gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number \|\| github.event.pull_request.number }}` | ‚ùå | Alias workflows handle both contexts without cancellation |
| Other triggers | `gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}` | ‚ùå | Default behavior for schedule, push, etc. |

**Benefits:**
- **Better Isolation**: Workflows operating on different issues/PRs can run concurrently
- **Conflict Prevention**: No interference between unrelated workflow executions  
- **Resource Management**: Pull request workflows can cancel previous runs when updated
- **Predictable Behavior**: Consistent concurrency rules based on trigger type

**Examples:**

```yaml
# Issue workflow - no cancellation, isolated by issue number
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
# Generates: group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number }}"

# PR workflow - with cancellation, isolated by PR number  
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
# Generates: group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.ref }}"
#           cancel-in-progress: true

# Mixed workflow - handles both issues and PRs with cancellation
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
# Generates: group: "gh-aw-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.event.issue.number || github.event.pull_request.number }}"
#           cancel-in-progress: true
```

If you need custom concurrency behavior, you can override the automatic generation by specifying your own `concurrency` section in the frontmatter.

### Environment Variables

```yaml
env:
  CUSTOM_VAR: "value"
  SECRET_VAR: ${{ secrets.MY_SECRET }}
```

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
if: github.event_name == 'push'
```

### Custom Steps

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Custom setup
    run: echo "Custom step before agentic execution"
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
    with:
      node-version: '18'
```

## Complete Example

```yaml
---
name: Comprehensive Issue Handler
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
  alias:
    name: issue-bot
