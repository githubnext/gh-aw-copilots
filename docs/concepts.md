# 📖 Introduction to GitHub Agentic Workflows

Now that you've [got your first workflow running](quick-start.md), let's dive deeper into the concepts and capabilities of GitHub Agentic Workflows.

GitHub Agentic Workflows represent a new paradigm where AI agents can perform complex, multi-step tasks in conjunction with your team automatically. They combine the power of AI with GitHub's collaboration platform to enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) — the systematic, automated application of AI to software collaboration.

GitHub Agentic Workflows are both revolutionary and yet familiar: they build on top of GitHub Actions, and use familiar AI engines such as Claude Code and Codex to interpret natural language instructions.

## Core Concepts

### What makes a workflow "agentic"?

Traditional GitHub Actions follow pre-programmed steps. Agentic workflows use AI to:

- **Understand context** — Read and analyze repository content, issues, PRs, and discussions
- **Make decisions** — Determine what actions to take based on the current situation  
- **Use tools** — Interact with GitHub APIs, external services, and repository files
- **Generate content** — Create meaningful comments, documentation, and code changes
- **Learn and adapt** — Adjust behavior based on past action, feedback and outcomes
- **Productive ambiguity** — Interpret natural language instructions flexibly and productively

One crucial difference from regular agentic prompting is that GitHub Agentic Workflows can contain **both** traditional GitHub Actions steps and agentic natural language instructions. This allows the best of both worlds: traditional steps for deterministic actions, and agentic steps for flexible, context-aware AI-driven actions.

### The anatomy of an agentic workflow

Every agentic workflow has two main parts:

1. **Frontmatter (YAML)** — Configuration that defines triggers, permissions, and available tools
2. **Instructions (Markdown)** — Natural language description of what the AI should do

```markdown
---
on: ...
permissions: ...
tools: ...
steps: ...
---

# Natural Language Instructions
Analyze this issue and provide helpful triage comments...
```

One crucial difference from traditional agentic prompting is that GitHub Agentic Workflows can contain **both** traditional GitHub Actions steps and agentic natural language instructions. This allows the best of both worlds: traditional steps for deterministic actions, and agentic steps for flexible, context-aware AI-driven actions.

See [Workflow Structure](workflow-structure.md) and [Frontmatter Options](frontmatter.md) for details of file layout and configuration options.

## Understanding AI Engines

Agentic workflows are powered by different agentic AI engines:

- **Claude Code** (default) — Anthropic's AI engine, excellent for reasoning and code analysis
- **Codex** (experimental) — OpenAI's code-focused engine

The engine interprets your natural language instructions and executes them using the tools and permissions you've configured.

### Continuous AI Patterns

GitHub Agentic Workflows enable [Continuous AI](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai) — the systematic application of AI to software collaboration:

- **Continuous Documentation** — Keep docs current and comprehensive
- **Continuous Code Improvement** — Incrementally enhance code quality
- **Continuous Triage** — Intelligent issue and PR management
- **Continuous Research** — Stay current with industry developments
- **Continuous Quality** — Automated code review and standards enforcement

## Advanced Concepts

### Lock Files and Compilation

When you modify a `.md` workflow file, you need to compile it:

```bash
gh aw compile
```

This generates a `.lock.yml` file containing the actual GitHub Actions workflow. Both files should be committed to your repository.

The `.lock.yml` file contains the full configuration of the workflow, including the frontmatter and the compiled agentic steps, added security hardening and job orchestration. The `.md` file is the source of truth for authoring and editing.

### Security and Permissions

Agentic workflows require careful security consideration:

- **Minimal permissions** — Grant only what the workflow needs
- **Tool allowlists** — Explicitly specify which tools the AI can use  
- **Input validation** — All inputs are automatically sanitized
- **Human oversight** — Critical actions can require human approval

See [Security Notes](security-notes.md) for comprehensive guidelines.

### Tools and MCPs

Workflows can use various tools through the Model Context Protocol (MCP):

- **GitHub tools** — Repository management, issue/PR operations
- **External APIs** — Integration with third-party services
- **File operations** — Read, write, and analyze repository files
- **Custom MCPs** — Build your own tool integrations

Learn more in [Tools Configuration](tools.md) and [MCPs](mcps.md).

## Building Effective Workflows

### Best Practices

1. **Start simple** — Begin with basic workflows and add complexity gradually
2. **Be specific** — Clear, detailed instructions produce better results
3. **Test iteratively** — Use `gh aw compile --watch` and `gh aw run` during development
4. **Monitor costs** — Use `gh aw logs` to track AI usage and optimize
5. **Review outputs** — Always verify AI-generated content before merging
6. **Use safe outputs** — Leverage [Safe Output Processing](safe-outputs.md) to automatically create issues, comments, and PRs from agent output

### Common Patterns

- **Event-driven** — Respond to issues, PRs, pushes, etc.
- **Scheduled** — Regular maintenance and reporting tasks
- **Alias-triggered** — Activated by @mentions in comments
- **Secure** — User minimal permissions and protect against untrusted content, see [Security Notes](security-notes.md)
