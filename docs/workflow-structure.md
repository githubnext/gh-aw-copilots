# ðŸ“‹ Workflow Structure

This guide explains how agentic workflows are organized and structured within your repository.

## Directory Structure

Agentic workflows are stored in the `.github/workflows` folder as Markdown files (`*.md`)
and they are compiled to GitHub Actions Workflows files (`*.lock.yml`)

```
.github/
â””â”€â”€ workflows/
  â”œâ”€â”€ weekly-research.md # Agentic Workflow
  â””â”€â”€ weekly-research.lock.yml # Compiled GitHub Actions Workflow
```

Create a markdown file in `.github/workflows/` with the following structure:

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened]

permissions:
  issues: write

tools:
  github:
    allowed: [add_issue_comment]
---

# Workflow Description

Read the issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}. Add a comment to the issue listing useful resources and links.
```

then run the `compile` command to generate the lock file.

```sh
gh aw compile
```

## File Organization

Your repository structure will look like this:

```
your-repository/
â”œâ”€â”€ .github/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ workflows/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ issue-responder.md        # Your source workflow
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ issue-responder.lock.yml  # Generated GitHub Actions file
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ weekly-summary.md         # Another source workflow
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ weekly-summary.lock.yml   # Generated GitHub Actions file
â””â”€â”€ ... (other repository files)
```

## Workflow File Format

Each workflow consists of:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Configuration options wrapped in `---`. See [Frontmatter Options](frontmatter.md) for details.
2. **Markdown Content**: Natural language instructions for the AI

### Example Workflow File

```markdown
---
on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, reopened]
  reaction: "eyes"

permissions:
  issues: write
  contents: read

tools:
  github:
    allowed:
    - add_issue_comment
---

# Issue Auto-Responder

Analyze the issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} on GitHub.

1. Determine if it's a bug report, feature request, or question
2. Add appropriate labels based on the content
3. Provide a helpful initial response with:
   - Acknowledgment of the issue
   - Request for additional information if needed
   - Links to relevant documentation
```

> `gh aw compile --instructions`

## Generated Files

When you run `gh aw compile`, the system:

1. **Reads** your `.md` files from `.github/workflows/`
2. **Processes** the frontmatter and markdown content
3. **Generates** corresponding `.lock.yml` GitHub Actions workflow files
4. **Updates** `.gitattributes` to mark generated files

### Lock File Characteristics

- **Automatic Generation**: Never edit `.lock.yml` files manually
- **Complete Workflows**: Contains full GitHub Actions YAML
- **Security**: Includes proper permissions and secret handling
- **MCP Integration**: Sets up Model Context Protocol servers (see [MCP Guide](mcps.md))
- **Artifact Collection**: Automatically saves logs and outputs

## Expressions in Markdown Content

For security reasons, agentic workflows restrict which GitHub Actions expressions can be used in **markdown content**. This prevents potential security vulnerabilities from unauthorized access to secrets or environment variables.

> **Note**: These restrictions apply only to expressions in the markdown content portion of workflows. The YAML frontmatter can still use secrets and environment variables as needed for workflow configuration (e.g., `env:` and authentication).

### Allowed Expressions

The following GitHub Actions context expressions are permitted in the markdown content:

#### GitHub Context Expressions

- `${{ github.event.after }}` - The SHA of the most recent commit on the ref after the push
- `${{ github.event.before }}` - The SHA of the most recent commit on the ref before the push
- `${{ github.event.check_run.id }}` - The ID of the check run that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.check_suite.id }}` - The ID of the check suite that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.comment.id }}` - The ID of the comment that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.deployment.id }}` - The ID of the deployment that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.deployment_status.id }}` - The ID of the deployment status that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.head_commit.id }}` - The ID of the head commit for the push event
- `${{ github.event.installation.id }}` - The ID of the GitHub App installation
- `${{ github.event.issue.number }}` - The number of the issue that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.label.id }}` - The ID of the label that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.milestone.id }}` - The ID of the milestone that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.organization.id }}` - The ID of the organization that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.page.id }}` - The ID of the page build that triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.event.project.id }}` - The ID of the project that triggered the workflow

- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.id }}` - The ID of the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion }}` - The conclusion of the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url }}` - The URL of the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.head_sha }}` - The head SHA of the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.run_number }}` - The run number of the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.event }}` - The event that triggered the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.event.workflow_run.status }}` - The status of the workflow run that triggered the current workflow
- `${{ github.actor }}` - The username of the user who triggered the workflow
- `${{ github.job }}` - Job ID of the current workflow run
- `${{ github.owner }}` - The owner of the repository (user or organization name)
- `${{ github.repository }}` - The owner and repository name (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`)
- `${{ github.run_id }}` - A unique number for each workflow run within a repository

#### Special Pattern Expressions
- `${{ needs.* }}` - Any outputs from previous jobs (e.g., `${{ needs.task.outputs.text }}`)
- `${{ steps.* }}` - Any outputs from previous steps in the same job
- `${{ github.event.inputs.* }}` - Any workflow inputs when triggered by workflow_dispatch (e.g., `${{ github.event.inputs.name }}`)

### Prohibited Expressions

All other expressions are dissallowed.

### Security Rationale

This restriction prevents:
- **Secret leakage**: Prevents accidentally exposing secrets in AI prompts or logs
- **Environment variable exposure**: Protects sensitive configuration from being accessed
- **Code injection**: Prevents complex expressions that could execute unintended code
- **Expression injection**: Prevents malicious expressions from being injected into AI prompts
- **Prompt hijacking**: Stops unauthorized modification of workflow instructions through expression values
- **Cross-prompt information attacks (XPIA)**: Blocks attempts to leak information between different workflow executions

### Validation

Expression safety is validated during compilation with `gh aw compile`. If unauthorized expressions are found, you'll see an error like:

```
error: unauthorized expressions: [secrets.TOKEN, env.MY_VAR]. 
allowed: [github.repository, github.actor, github.workflow, ...]
```

### Example Valid Usage

```markdown
# Valid expressions
Repository: ${{ github.repository }}
Triggered by: ${{ github.actor }}  
Issue number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
Previous output: ${{ needs.task.outputs.text }}
User input: ${{ github.event.inputs.environment }}
Workflow run conclusion: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion }}

# Invalid expressions (will cause compilation error)
Token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Environment: ${{ env.MY_VAR }}
Complex: ${{ toJson(github.workflow) }}
```

## Best Practices

- Use descriptive names: `issue-responder.md`, `pr-reviewer.md`
- Follow kebab-case convention: `weekly-summary.md`
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- **Commit source files**: Always commit `.md` files
- **Commit generated files**: Also commit `.lock.yml` files for transparency
