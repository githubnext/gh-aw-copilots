# ✨ GitHub Agentic Workflows

Write agentic workflows in natural language markdown, and run them in GitHub Actions. From [GitHub Next](https://githubnext.com/).

> [!CAUTION]
> This extension is a research demonstrator. It is in early development and may change significantly.

Use it with caution, and at your own risk.
